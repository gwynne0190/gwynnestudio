<!-- <p>The website was originally launched 7th April 2021, around that time hasn't been any more content other than the main page for navigation use, contact information page. The domain itself was used to create a pleroma instance pl.gwynnestudio.com. The server was shut down automatically on 4th of August in 2021 as I've abandon it around the time.</p>

<p>Hello everyone, my name is Rei. My real existence resides here on internet, where I can pretty much put all kinds of trash around, and everyone could find me. For all good intent as a warning to anyone who is easily disturbed or expect a kind of consistency to my creations; not all of what I create is equal. So feel free to look the other way if you feel discomfort.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h5>I do what</h5>
<p>I usually write short stories, but recently this year I've gotten into a bit of voice acting. though I haven't done any projects. Contact me via email if you want to use my voice.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h5>Art</h5>
<p>I might post it in my personal microblog account (if you ever come across one), I don't have a dedicated page for art at the moment.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h5>Let's play videos</h5>
<p>I've always wanted to play video games on youtube. So I'll probably do that soon, maybe in my own website.</p>
